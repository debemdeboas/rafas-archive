This repository is a collection of my notes, thoughts, and ideas.
It is a place where I can store and organize my knowledge.
It is a place where I can share my knowledge with others.

It is a place where I can grow as a person.
It is a place where I can be myself.

## Design Philosophy

We follow US Graphic Company's design philosophy:

> Emergent over prescribed aesthetics.<br>
> Expose state and inner workings.<br>
> Dense, not sparse.<br>
> Explicit is better than implicit.<br>
> Engineered for Human vision and perception.<br>
> Regiment functionalism.<br>
> Performance is design.<br>
> Verbosity over opacity.<br>
> Ignore design trends. Timeless and unfashionable.<br>
> Flat, not hierarchical.<br>
> Diametrically opposite of minimalism,<br>
> as complex as it needs to be.<br>
> Driven by objective reasoning and common sense.<br>
> Don't infantilize users.<br>
